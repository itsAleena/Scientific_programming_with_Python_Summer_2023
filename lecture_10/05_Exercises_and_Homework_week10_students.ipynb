    "This is a simplified explanation, why the task 2.3 has some importance for CCD astronomy tasks. \n",
    "\n",
    "Usually optical astronomy is done with cooled CCD devices, which have the advantage of low readout noise characteristics. The noise is always created when you readout the charge of a pixel which is the light representation. Also during the readout a so called \"bias\" value is added. This is because the values from the CCDs are usually positive integers and e.g. real values `0` with noise can be positive or negative. This bias value is not a real signal and during the data analysis this value has to substracted. To do this task a so called bias image is taken which only shows effects from the readout process. Science images have also this bias values, so that for any science image a bias can be substracted for correction. Flat images are also important images in the optical astronomy. Usually in optical astronomy images are taken through special defined filters which then can be used to characterize the object from this color. The problem with filters in a telescope light path is than the complete CCD will not get the light homogeneously, also if you have small dust particles on a filter this can have some effect. Flat images which have enough signal on a CCD image can be used to correct for this problem. In fact you can calculate per pixel the amount of correction needed so that light on a CCD is homogeneously. For this correction a flat image is normalized to 1, which means that the original image is divided by the mean value. \n",
    "\n",
    "In the end a real science image will be calculated like this:\n",
    "\n",
    "```\n",
    "science_image = (real_science_image - bias_image) / flat_image\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "Of course, usually for the correction one will not take a single image but would take a mean of several images. This will also reduce noise effects. However, with the recent `rpn` implementation this is not possible, but one can think also of a new extension of the `rpn` class."
