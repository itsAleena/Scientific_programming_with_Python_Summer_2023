    "## About the Projects\n",
    "- You will get one project approximately every other week.\n",
    "- Besides the homework-assignments, you need to solve the projects in order to pass the course. Your final course mark consists of the mean of your project marks. We aim to hand-out six projects during the term and we do not consider the worst project mark for your final course mark. Projects that you do not hand in are counted with a mark of 4.\n",
    "- The projects needs to be submitted by uploading a Unix-`tar` archive containing the files in the `word_game_qt5_students` folder to [Projects/Project 5](https://ecampus.uni-bonn.de/goto_ecampus_exc_3025921.html) on eCampus. The name of your `tar`-archive should be `YOUR_NAME.tgz`. Please only include the two files mentioned above and *no* other files. Your project must be on eCampus by Thursday, 22.06.2023, 23:55. **No late uploads can be accepted!**\n",
    "- **In contrast to the homework exercises, each student must hand in an own solution for the projects! Of course you can and should discuss problems with each other! However, you need to be able to explain your solution in detail to your tutor and/or the lecturers! We might ask you for an interview about your project if the solution is (close to) identical to another students submission.**\n",
    "\n",
    "**Notes:** (1) This project asks you to write and modify `Python`-scripts and -modules which needs to be developed for and executed on a `Linux`-environment, e.g. the `Desktop` within our Jupyterlab system; (2) The tutors, and I are very happy to help you out with difficulties you might have with the project tasks! You can ask questions any time but please do so well in advance of the deadlines!"

    " * the graphical UI is optimized for running in the Desktop-part of the online jupyterlab-system, on Linux- and MacOS systems. For Windows Users the UI will not be displayed properly, I'm working on this issue, but for the time being, use the our online system. For Linux and MacOS systems, we used an anaconda python installation in which you need the packages `qt` and `pyqt`. \n",
    " * starting the UI you can go to the `word_game_qt5` directory, which contains a script `word_game.sh` which runs the program properly. Despite of any previous projects, for this project it is absolutely necessary that you don't modify any of the provided files except `player.py` which has the user logic of the game\n",
    " * there are many special files for the implementation of the graphical UI which is not perfect, but it does what it should. If you want to modify the UI, have a look for the program `Qt creator` and the `pyqt5`-programming interface. We cannot give support for the details of the `Qt5` implementation, but if you have some questions also after the semester I'm happy to share my experience!"
