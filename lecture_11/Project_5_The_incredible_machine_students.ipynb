    "## About the Projects\n",
    "- You will get one project approximately every other week.\n",
    "- Besides the homework-assignments, you need to solve the projects in order to pass the course. Your final course mark consists of the mean of your project marks. We aim to hand-out six projects during the term and we do not consider the worst project mark for your final course mark. Projects that you do not hand in are counted with a mark of 4.\n",
    "- The projects needs to be submitted by uploading a Unix-`tar` archive containing the modified files `machine.py`, this notebook and probable additional files to [Projects/Project 5](https://ecampus.uni-bonn.de/goto_ecampus_exc_3025921.html) on eCampus. The name of your `tar`-archive should be `YOUR_NAME.tgz`. Please only include the  mentioned files above and *no* other files. Your project must be on eCampus by Thursday, 22.06.2023, 23:55. **No late uploads can be accepted!**\n",
    "- **In contrast to the homework exercises, each student must hand in an own solution for the projects! Of course you can and should discuss problems with each other! However, you need to be able to explain your solution in detail to your tutor and/or the lecturers! We might ask you for an interview about your project if the solution is (close to) identical to another students submission.**\n",
    "\n",
    "**Notes:** (1) In this project you can decide if you work in total with `Python`-scripts and -modules which needs to be developed for and executed on a `Linux`-environment, e.g. the `Desktop` within our Jupyterlab system or you can use the Jupyterlab-Editor and -Notebook (2) The tutors,  and I are very happy to help you out with difficulties you might have with the project tasks! You can ask questions any time but please do so well in advance of the deadlines!"

    "More than 25 years ago, there was a famous computer game \"The incredible machine\". I've see only a later version but the idea was to create a machine in which you can lead a ball through a labyrinth of walls and different small machines and tools which then solve a problem. \n",

    "In this project, we only use a few parts of the possibilities of the simulation engine. One idea of the concept, that you can e.g. create forces or wall which works only for specific regions. So it is possible to simulate a bullet flying through different materials to see how this material changes the speed over time. Also you can create complex setup of walls and check which initial speed is necessary to bring a ball in a special target position. I guess that this simple program has a lot of possibilities and can create also a little bit fun!"
