    "## About the Projects\n",
    "- You will get one project approximately every other week.\n",
    "- Besides the homework-asignmentts, you need to solve the projects in order to pass the course. Your final course mark consists of the mean of your project marks. We aim to hand-out five projects during the term and we do not consider the worst project mark for your final course mark. Projects that you do not hand in are counted with a mark of 4.\n",
    "- The projects needs to be submitted by uploading a modified version of this notebook to [Projects/Project 2](https://ecampus.uni-bonn.de/goto_ecampus_exc_3025921.html) on eCampus. Please only upload this notebook and no other files. You also do not need to change its filename before your upload. Your project must be on eCampus by Thursday, 25.05.2023, 23:55. **No late uploads can be accepted!**\n",
    "- **In contrast to the homework exercises, each student must hand in an own solution for the projects! Of course you can and should discuss problems with each other! However, you need to be able to explain your solution in detail to your tutor and/or the lecturers! We might ask you for an interview about your project if the solution is (close to) identical to another students submission.**\n",

    "**Note:** The tutors, Thomas and I are very happy to help you out with difficulties you might have with the project tasks! You can ask questions any time but please do so well in advance of the deadlines!"
